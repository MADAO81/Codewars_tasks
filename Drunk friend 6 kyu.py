# Drunk friend
# You're hanging out with your friends in a bar, when suddenly one of them is so drunk, 
# that he can't speak, and when he wants to say something, he writes it down on a paper. 
# However, none of the words he writes make sense to you. He wants to help you, 
# so he points at a beer and writes "yvvi". 
# You start to understand what he's trying to say, and you write a script, that decodes his words.

# Keep in mind that numbers, as well as other characters, 
# can be part of the input, and you should keep them like they are. 
# You should also test if the input is a string. If it is not, 
# return "Input is not a string".
