# Task
# Your friend advised you to see a new performance in the most popular theater in the city. 
# He knows a lot about art and his advice is usually good, but not this time: the performance turned out to be awfully dull. 
# It's so bad you want to sneak out, which is quite simple, especially since the exit is located right behind your row to the left. 
# All you need to do is climb over your seat and make your way to the exit.

# The main problem is your shyness: you're afraid that you'll end up blocking the view (even if only for a couple of seconds) 
# of all the people who sit behind you and in your column or the columns to your left. To gain some courage, you decide to calculate 
# the number of such people and see if you can possibly make it to the exit without disturbing too many people.

# Given the total number of rows and columns in the theater (nRows and nCols, respectively), and the row and column you're sitting in, 
# return the number of people who sit strictly behind you and in your column or to the left, assuming all seats are occupied.

# Example
# For nCols = 16, nRows = 11, col = 5 and row = 3, the output should be 96.
