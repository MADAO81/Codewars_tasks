# Magic Sum of 3s
# The magic sum of 3s is calculated on an array by summing up odd numbers which include the digit 3.

# Complete the function which accepts an array of integers and returns its magic sum of 3s.

# Example: [3, 12, 5, 8, 30, 13] results in 16 (3 + 13)

# If there is no such number in the array, 0 should be returned.

def magic_sum(arr):
    digit = 3
    op_arr = []
    for i in arr:
        if i % 2 != 0 and str(digit) in str(i):
            op_arr.append(i)
    return sum(op_arr)
    
# def magic_sum(arr):
#     return arr and sum(x for x in arr if x%2 and '3' in str(x)) or 0
