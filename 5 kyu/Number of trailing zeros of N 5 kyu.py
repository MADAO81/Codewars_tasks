# Write a program that will calculate the number of trailing zeros in a factorial of a given number.

# N! = 1 * 2 * 3 *  ... * N

# Be careful 1000! has 2568 digits...

# For more info, see: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Factorial.html

# Examples
# N	Product	N factorial	Trailing zeros
# 6	1*2*3*4*5*6	720	1
# 12	1*2*3*4*5*6*7*8*9*10*11*12	479001600	2
# Hint: You're not meant to calculate the factorial. Find another way to find the number of zeros.
