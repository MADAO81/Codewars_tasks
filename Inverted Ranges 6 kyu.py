# Inverted Ranges
# A range of numbers is represented as a tuple of two numbers, 
# for example [0, 10] would indicate a range between 0 and 10 inclusively.

# The inverse of a range between some bounds are the ranges from the lower bound, 
# to the lowest part of the range and the upper part of the range to the upper bound.

# For example:

# Given the range [25, 75]
# And the lower bound 0
# And the upper bound 100
# The inverse ranges would be [[0, 24], [76, 100]].

# Write a function invertedRanges which when given a list of ranges, returns the inverse 
# of those ranges with a lower bound of 0 and an upper bound of 100.

# All ranges will be between 0 and 100, they will be given in order and will not overlap

# Examples:

# An empty list of ranges would return a list with a single range between 0 and 100:

# invertedRanges([]) == [[0, 100]];
# A list of ranges which cover numbers between 0 and 100 would return an empty list

# invertedRanges([[0, 100]]) == [];
# invertedRanges([[0, 50], [51, 100]]) == [];
# A list of ranges which cover some numbers between 0 and 100 must return the ranges that aren't covered

# invertedRanges([[0, 25], [51, 75]]) == [[26, 50], [76, 100]];
