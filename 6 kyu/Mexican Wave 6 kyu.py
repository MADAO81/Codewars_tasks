# Mexican Wave
# Task
# In this simple Kata your task is to create a function that turns a string into a Mexican Wave. 
# You will be passed a string and you must return that string in an array where an uppercase letter is a person standing up. 
# Rules
#  1.  The input string will always be lower case but maybe empty.

#  2.  If the character in the string is whitespace then pass over it as if it was an empty seat
# Example
# wave("hello") => ["Hello", "hEllo", "heLlo", "helLo", "hellO"]

def wave(people):
    result = []
    for indx, char in enumerate(people):
        if char == " ":
            pass
        else:
            el_people = list(people)
            el_people[indx] = el_people[indx].upper()
            el_people = "".join(el_people)
            result.append(el_people)
    return result
    
# def wave(str):
#     return [str[:i] + str[i].upper() + str[i+1:] for i in range(len(str)) if str[i].isalpha()]
