# Write a function that takes a string of braces, and determines if the order of the braces is valid. It should return true if the string is valid, and false if it's invalid.

# This Kata is similar to the Valid Parentheses Kata, but introduces new characters: brackets [], and curly braces {}. Thanks to @arnedag for the idea!

# All input strings will be nonempty, and will only consist of parentheses, brackets and curly braces: ()[]{}.

# What is considered Valid?
# A string of braces is considered valid if all braces are matched with the correct brace.

# Examples
# "(){}[]"   =>  True
# "([{}])"   =>  True
# "(}"       =>  False
# "[(])"     =>  False
# "[({})](]" =>  False

    braces = {"(": ")", "[": "]", "{": "}"}
    stack = []
    for character in string:
        if character in braces.keys():
            stack.append(character)
        else:
            if len(stack) == 0 or braces[stack.pop()] != character:
                return False
    return len(stack) == 0

#       s=s.replace('()','')
#   return s=='
