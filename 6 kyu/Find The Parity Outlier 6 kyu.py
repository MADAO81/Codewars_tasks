# Find The Parity Outlier
# You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, 
# but could be very large) containing integers. 
# The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers 
# except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.

# Examples
# [2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36] -->  11 (the only odd number)

# [160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21] --> 160 (the only even number)

def find_outlier(integers):
    a = 0
    b = 0 
    c = 0
    d = 0 
    for i in integers:
        if i % 2 == 0:
            a = i
            b += 1
        else:
            c = i
            d += 1
    if b == 1:
        return a
    else:
        return c
 
#  def find_outlier(int):
#     odds = [x for x in int if x%2!=0]
#     evens= [x for x in int if x%2==0]
#     return odds[0] if len(odds)<len(evens) else evens[0]
