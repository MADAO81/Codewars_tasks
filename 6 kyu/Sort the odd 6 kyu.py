# Sort the odd
# Task
# You will be given an array of numbers. You have to sort the odd numbers in ascending order while leaving the even numbers at their original positions.

# Examples
# [7, 1]  =>  [1, 7]
# [5, 8, 6, 3, 4]  =>  [3, 8, 6, 5, 4]
# [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]  =>  [1, 8, 3, 6, 5, 4, 7, 2, 9, 0]


def sort_array(source_array):
    odds = []
    answer = [] 
    for i in source_array:
        if i % 2 > 0:
            odds.append(i)
            answer.append("X")
            
        else:
            answer.append(i)
            
    odds.sort()
    
    for i in odds:
        x = answer.index("X")
        answer[x] = i
    return answer

# def sort_array(arr):
#  odds = sorted((x for x in arr if x%2 != 0), reverse=True)
#  return [x if x%2==0 else odds.pop() for x in arr]
