# Crash Override
# Every budding hacker needs an alias! The Phantom Phreak, Acid Burn,
# Zero Cool and Crash Override are some notable examples from the film Hackers.
#
# Your task is to create a function that, given a proper first and last name, will return the correct alias.
#
# Notes:
# Two objects that return a one word name in response to the first letter of the first name and one
# for the first letter of the surname are already given. See the examples below for further details.
#
# If the first character of either of the names given to the function is not a letter
# from A - Z, you should return "Your name must start with a letter from A - Z."
#
# Sometimes people might forget to capitalize the first letter of their name so your function should accommodate
# for these grammatical errors.
