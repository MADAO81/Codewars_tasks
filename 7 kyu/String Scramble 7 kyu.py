# Given a string and an array of indices, rearrange the characters of the string so that each character is placed at the position specified by the corresponding index in the array.

# Example
# input: "abcd", [0, 3, 1, 2]
# output: "acdb"
# Explanation
# The character 'a' is placed at index 0.

# The character 'b' is placed at index 3.

# The character 'c' is placed at index 1.

# The character 'd' is placed at index 2.

# Notes
# The string and the array will be of equal length.

# The string will contain valid characters (A-Z, a-z, or 0-9);
# the array will contain valid indices.

def scramble(string, array):
    return "".join(v for _, v in sorted(zip(array, string)))

# def scramble(string, lst):
#     result = [None] * len(string)
#     for char, index in zip(string, lst):
#         result[index] = char
#     return "".join(result)
