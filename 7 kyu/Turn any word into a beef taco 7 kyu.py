# Turn any word into a beef taco
# If you like Taco Bell, you will be familiar with their signature doritos locos taco. They're very good.

# Why can't everything be a taco? We're going to attempt that here, turning every word we find into the taco bell recipe with each ingredient.

# We want to input a word as a string, and return a list representing that word as a taco.

# Key

# all vowels (except 'y') = beef

# t = tomato

# l = lettuce

# c = cheese

# g = guacamole

# s = salsa

# NOTE
# We do not care about case here. 'S' is therefore equivalent to 's' in our taco.

# Ignore all other letters; we don't want our taco uneccesarily clustered or else it will be too difficult to eat.

# Note that no matter what ingredients are passed, our taco will always have a shell.
