# Task
# Given a Divisor and a Bound , Find the largest integer N , Such That ,
# Conditions :
# N is divisible by divisor
# N is less than or equal to bound
# N is greater than 0.
# Notes
# The parameters (divisor, bound) passed to the function are only positive values .

def max_multiple(divisor, bound):
    result = 0
    for i in range(bound+1):
        if i % divisor == 0:
            result = i
    return result

# def max_multiple(divisor, bound):
#     return bound - (bound % divisor)
