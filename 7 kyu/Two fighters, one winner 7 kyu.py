# Create a function that returns the name of the winner in a fight between two fighters.

# Each fighter takes turns attacking the other and whoever kills the other first is victorious. Death is defined as having health <= 0.

# Each fighter will be a Fighter object/instance. See the Fighter class below in your chosen language.

# Both health and damagePerAttack (damage_per_attack for python) will be integers larger than 0. You can mutate the Fighter objects.

# Your function also receives a third argument, a string, with the name of the fighter that attacks first.

# Example:
#   declare_winner(Fighter("Lew", 10, 2), Fighter("Harry", 5, 4), "Lew") => "Lew"
  
#   Lew attacks Harry; Harry now has 3 health.
#   Harry attacks Lew; Lew now has 6 health.
#   Lew attacks Harry; Harry now has 1 health.
#   Harry attacks Lew; Lew now has 2 health.
#   Lew attacks Harry: Harry now has -1 health and is dead. Lew wins.
