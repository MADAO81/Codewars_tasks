# [Code Golf] Does your source code contain this character?
# Given a character, return True if your source code (the one from solution tab) contains this character or False if it doesn't.

# Example
# d('d')  # probably True, because the name of the function is 'd', unless you obfuscate it
# Importing is disabled. You also may not use open('solution.py') to fetch your code from the file system, that's cheating.

# Keep your code short (under 33 characters)
