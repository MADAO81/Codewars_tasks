# Array Array Array
# You are given an initial 2-value array (x). You will use this to calculate a score.

# If both values in (x) are numbers, the score is the sum of the two. 
# If only one is a number, the score is that number. If neither is a number, return 'Void!'.

# Once you have your score, you must return an array of arrays. Each sub array will be the 
# same as (x) and the number of sub arrays should be equal to the score.

# For example:

# if (x) == ['a', 3] you should return [['a', 3], ['a', 3], ['a', 3]].
