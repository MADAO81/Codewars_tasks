# Your collegue wrote an simple loop to list his favourite animals. But there seems to be a minor mistake in the grammar, which prevents the program to work. Fix it! :)

# If you pass the list of your favourite animals to the function, you should get the list of the animals with orderings and newlines added.

# For example, passing in:

# [ "dog", "cat", "elephant" ]
# will result in:

# "1. dog\n2. cat\n3. elephant\n"

def list_animals(animals):
    lst = ""
    for i in range(len(animals)):
        lst += str(i+1) + ". " + animals[i] + "\n"
    return lst
