# Was the package received before it was sent? (Simplified)
# This kata explores simplified time zones
# Given tz_from, tz_to, start and duration, return a boolean that answers this question:
# "Was the package received the day before it was sent?"
# Details
# Time zones are represented by integers -11 to +12 inclusive (including zero),
# one zone per hour for a total of 24 zones in one day. This simplification ignores zones 
# below -11 and above +12, 30- and 45-minute offsets, daylight savings, and time folds.
# A package is sent between two time zones: tz_from and tz_to, initiated at local hour start 
# (integer between 0 to 23, 24hr clock). The delivery takes duration hours to complete (integer between 0 to 24, inclusive).
# Examples
# Eg 1.
# Given tz_from=3, tz_to=0, start=13, duration=1, return False. A package sent at 13:00 
# from time zone 3 takes 1 hour to be delivered to time zone 0. The package is received 
# at 11:00 local time, the same day it was sent. Return "False" as it was not received the day before it was sent.
# Eg 2.
# Given tz_from=12, tz_to=-3, start=5, duration=8, return True. A package sent at 05:00 
# from time zone 12 takes 8 hours to be delivered to time zone -3. The package is received 
# at 22:00 local time, the day before it was sent. Return "True" as it was received the day before it was sent.

def was_package_received_yesterday(tz_from, tz_to, start, duration):
    return start < tz_from - tz_to - duration

# def was_package_received_yesterday(tz_from, tz_to, start, duration):
    # Calculate the time difference between the two time zones
    # time_diff = tz_to - tz_from

    # 'start_day' and 'finish_day' represent the "day indices" based on 24-hour intervals.
    # 'start_day' is always 0 since the package is sent on the same day it starts.
    # 'finish_day' is calculated based on the total time (start + duration + time_diff):
    #   0 -> same day delivery
    #   1 -> next day delivery
    #  -1 -> delivery on the previous day (due to time zone shifts)
   # start_day = 0
   # finish_day = (start + duration + time_diff) // 24

    # Return True if the package was delivered on the previous day (due to time zone shifts!)
   # return finish_day < start_day
