# All Star Code Challenge #18
# Create a function that accepts a string and a single character, and returns an integer of the count of occurrences the 2nd argument is found in the first one.

# If no occurrences can be found, a count of 0 should be returned.

# ("Hello", 'o')  =>  1
# ("Hello", 'l')  =>  2
# ("", 'z')       =>  0
# Notes
# The first argument can be an empty string
# In languages with no distinct character data type, the second argument will be a string of length 1

def str_count(strng, letter):
    counter = 0
    for ch in strng:
        if ch == letter:
            counter +=1
    return counter


# def strCount(string, letter):
#     return string.count(letter)
