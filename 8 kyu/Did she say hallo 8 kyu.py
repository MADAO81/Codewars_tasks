# You received a whatsup message from an unknown number. Could it be from that girl/boy with a foreign accent you met yesterday evening?

# Write a simple function to check if the string contains the word hallo in different languages.

# These are the languages of the possible people you met the night before:

# hello - english
# ciao - italian
# salut - french
# hallo - german
# hola - spanish
# ahoj - czech republic
# czesc - polish
# Notes

# you can assume the input is a string.
# to keep this a beginner exercise you don't need to check if the greeting is a subset of word (Hallowen can pass the test)
# function should be case insensitive to pass the tests


def validate_hello(greetings):
    greet_list =["hello", "ciao", "salut","hallo","hola", "ahoj", "czesc"]
    return any(greet in greetings.lower() for greet in greet_list)


# def validate_hello(greetings):
#     g = ['hello', 'ciao', 'salut', 'hallo', 'hola', 'ahoj', 'czesc']
#     for s in g:
#         if s in greetings.lower():
#             return True
#     return False
